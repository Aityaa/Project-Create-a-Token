MyToken Smart Contract
Overview
MyToken is a simple ERC20-like smart contract that allows minting and burning of tokens. It includes basic functionalities to handle a custom token with specified details such as name, abbreviation, and total supply. The contract keeps track of balances for different addresses and allows for minting new tokens to an address and burning tokens from an address.

Contract Details
Token Name: The_Name
Token Abbreviation: The_Abbrv
Total Supply: 0 (initially)
Functionalities
Public Variables
tokenName: Stores the name of the token.
tokenAbbrv: Stores the abbreviation of the token.
totalSupply: Tracks the total supply of the tokens.
Mapping
balances: Maps addresses to their respective token balances.
Functions
mint
solidity
Copy code
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public
The mint function allows the creation of new tokens. It increases the total supply and adds the specified amount to the balance of the given address.

_address: The address to which the new tokens will be assigned.
_value: The number of tokens to be created.
burn
solidity
Copy code
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public
The burn function allows the destruction of tokens. It decreases the total supply and deducts the specified amount from the balance of the given address. The function includes a check to ensure that the address has enough tokens to be burned.

_address: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
_value: The number of tokens to be destroyed.
Usage
Deploying the Contract
Deploy the MyToken contract to the desired blockchain network.
Use the provided functions to mint and burn tokens as needed.
Minting Tokens
To mint tokens, call the mint function with the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to be minted.

Example:

solidity
Copy code
myToken.mint(0xRecipientAddress, 100);
Burning Tokens
To burn tokens, call the burn function with the address and the amount of tokens to be burned. Ensure that the address has sufficient balance to burn the specified amount.

Example:

solidity
Copy code
myToken.burn(0xHolderAddress, 50);
